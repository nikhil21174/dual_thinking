**Running Code Locally**

Unzip the dataset from 
[human-confusion-dataset.0.3.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gqCEH999Co5PdIsMtT2LqjbDSrGV_y5U/view?usp=drive_link)

Move folder images, masks, and other csv files to the data folder.

The below code can be used to reproduce the results locally.

```
python main_release.py
```

We have uploaded the files generated by mmdetection for different models.
The files in the output folder can be generated by running the below code for different models.

```
python mmdetection_evaluate.py
```
